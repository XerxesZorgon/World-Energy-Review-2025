  {"id":"abdulkhaleqAdvancedMachineLearning2024","abstract":"Missing data is a common cause of uncertainty in reservoir characterization, especially in core analysis of porosity and permeability. This is due to the high cost and time required to gather core samples while drilling through the entire reservoir thickness. Therefore, the ability to collect core samples and directly assess petrophysical parameters is restricted by the small proportion of the reservoir thickness that can be measured by the retrieved cores. As a result, the absence of data has the potential to lead to inconsistent and imprecise classification of reservoirs and geomodeling, thereby increasing reservoir uncertainty. Therefore, imputation algorithms are needed to estimate petrophysical properties for incomplete intervals. This study comprehensively compares seven imputation techniques for predicting missing horizontal and vertical core permeability and core porosity data in a well drilled through a carbonate reservoir in a southern Iraqi gas field. The performance of each method was assessed using relative bias (RB) and reasonable descriptive statistical distributions (histogram, log view, and box plots of data ratios to compare the imputed and original data), and robustness to outliers (RtO). The results revealed that the random imputation of missing data (RIMD) technique is the most effective algorithm in addressing the 30.5% missing data (vertical permeability), resulting in the attainment of the RB value closest to zero (0.04076191) compared to other algorithms. Principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest (RF) yielded the most favorable results in terms of handling missing values and outliers for the 15% missing ratio dataset (core porosity and horizontal permeability). The advantages of these approaches are related to their capacity to independently and accurately impute the missing data without requiring extra information, such as well logging records. Additionally, the multiple imputation and machine learning algorithms fill missing values with adequate numbers based on dataset variable distributions and correlations. Multiple plausible values quantify the uncertainty in estimating missing data, avoiding false precision (as with single imputation). Also, the novel workflow involving multiple imputation methods accurately take into account the correlations and variances between the variables. The novel workflow developed for missing data imputation has the potential to be applied to other clastic and carbonate reservoirs in oil and gas fields. The entire data imputation workflow was conducted, validated, visualized by codes in R, a robust open-source statistical computing software.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdulkhaleq","given":"Hussein B."},{"family":"Khalil","given":"Khalil A."},{"family":"Al-Mudhafar","given":"Watheq J."},{"family":"Wood","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"abdulkhaleqAdvancedMachineLearning2024","container-title":"Geoenergy Science and Engineering","container-title-short":"Geoenergy Science and Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.geoen.2024.212900","ISSN":"2949-8910","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,1]]},"page":"212900","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Advanced machine learning for missing petrophysical property imputation applied to improve the characterization of carbonate reservoirs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949891024002707","volume":"238"},

  {"id":"stekhovenMissForestnonparametricMissingValue2012","abstract":"MOTIVATION: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously.\nRESULTS: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10% to 30%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data.\nAVAILABILITY: The package missForest is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/.\nCONTACT: stekhoven@stat.math.ethz.ch; buhlmann@stat.math.ethz.ch","author":[{"family":"Stekhoven","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"BÃ¼hlmann","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"stekhovenMissForestnonparametricMissingValue2012","container-title":"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btr597","ISSN":"1367-4811","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"112-118","PMID":"22039212","source":"PubMed","title":"MissForest--non-parametric missing value imputation for mixed-type data","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"tanMaterialBalanceMethod2021","abstract":"In order to clarify the characteristics of non-uniform water invasion in water-bearing gas reservoirs, it is necessary to introduce the non-uniformity coefficient (A) and water invasion constant (B) to characterize the non-uniformity degree of reservoir physical properties and the activity degree of peripheral water, respectively, based on the dual mechanism of water invasion to recharge the formation energy and seal off the gas in the reservoir. Then, the material balance method considering the phenomenon of water sealed gas was established. On this basis, the water invasion characteristic curve chart of water-bearing gas reservoirs was plotted, and the non-uniform water invasion mode was classified based on the example gas reservoir. And the following research results were obtained. First, in the water invasion characteristic curve chart of water-bearing gas reservoirs which is plotted based on the material balance method considering the influence of water sealed gas, the upper right area and the lower left area are defined as recharge area and seal area, respectively. By taking AÂ =Â 0 and BÂ =Â 2 as the boundary, the recharge area is divided into strong recharge area and weak recharge area. By taking AÂ =Â 2 and BÂ =Â 2 as the boundary, the seal area is divided into strong seal area and weak seal area. And correspondingly there are four water invasion modes, i.e., strong recharge, weak recharge, weak seal and strong seal. Second, for fractured gas reservoirs, the non-uniformity degree of reservoir physical properties is high, and water sealed gas can be formed easily after water invasion. The dimensionless relative pseudo-pressure data of this type of gas reservoir is located in the seal area of the water invasion characteristic curve chart. Third, for the gas reservoirs whose reservoir physical properties are relatively uniform, the dimensionless relative pseudo-pressure data is located in the recharge area of the water invasion characteristic curve chart, and the recharge effect of water invasion on formation energy is greater than the weakening effect of water sealed gas on formation energy. Fourth, with the increase of A, the non-uniformity degree of reservoir physical properties increases, the water invasion characteristic curve shifts from the upper right to the lower left, and the recovery factor of gas reservoir decreases continuously. With the increase of B, the recharge effect of water invasion on formation energy and the weakening effect of water sealed gas on formation energy are both weakened, the distribution range of water invasion characteristic curve narrows to the recharge/seal boundary, and the corresponding range of gas reservoir recovery factor also narrows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Xiaohua"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Gangzhen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaoping"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yingli"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Xiaoling"},{"family":"Kui","given":"Mingqing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Guojun"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Heng"}],"citation-key":"tanMaterialBalanceMethod2021","container-title":"Natural Gas Industry B","container-title-short":"Natural Gas Industry B","DOI":"10.1016/j.ngib.2021.07.005","ISSN":"2352-8540","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,1]]},"page":"353-358","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Material balance method and classification of non-uniform water invasion mode for water-bearing gas reservoirs considering the effect of water sealed gas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352854021000541","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"xiaoMachinelearningbasedWellProduction2022","abstract":"Shale gas production prediction under history-matching-based geomodel is crucial to achieve reliable assessment and economic management of unconventional shale resources, however, conventional history matching is generally performed through repeatedly running high-fidelity reservoir simulations and therefore presents intensive computation-cost in practical applications. Without the need of history matching step, this work presents an efficient and robust post-history production forecasting framework using a latent-space learning-based direct forecast approach, e.g., referred to as LS-LDFA. A novel dimensionality reduction method, e.g., convolutional autoencoder, is employed to regularize the multi-well time-series data by low-order representation within a latent space. Once the machine-learning proxy is trained offline, the online post-history production forecast can be efficiently achieved by input history data. This paper presents some comparative studies between LS-LDFA and model-based history matching. This approach is tested on two examples with an increasing complexity, e.g., a multi-fractured horizontal well and a naturally fractured reservoir model with multi-well-pad-production based on synthetic shale formation. The results confirm that the method achieves high robustness and computational efficiency simultaneously in comparison with the conventional history matching. The application of learning-based direct forecast approach can effectively fuse information from history data and thus support reliable decision-making and risk assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Xiao","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Guangdong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yayun"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Ya"}],"citation-key":"xiaoMachinelearningbasedWellProduction2022","container-title":"Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering","container-title-short":"Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.jngse.2022.104762","ISSN":"1875-5100","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,1]]},"page":"104762","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Machine-learning-based well production prediction under geological and hydraulic fracture parameters uncertainty for unconventional shale gas reservoirs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875510022003481","volume":"106"},
  {"id":"yehiaRemovingOutlierProduction2022","abstract":", Decline curve analysis (DCA) is one of the most common\ntools to\nestimate hydrocarbon reserves. Recently, many decline curve models\nhave been developed for unconventional reservoirs because of the complex\ndriving mechanisms and production systems of such resources. DCA is\nsubjected to some uncertainties. These uncertainties are mainly related\nto the data size available for regression, the quality of the data,\nand the selected decline curve model/s to be used. In this research,\nfirst, 20 decline curve models were summarized. For each model, the\nfour basic equations were completed analytically. Second, 16 decline\ncurve models were used with different data sizes and then a machine\nlearning (ML) algorithm was used to detect the outlier from shale\ngas production data with different thresholds of 10, 15, and 20%.\nAfter that, the 16 models were compared based on different data sizes\nand the three levels of data quality. The results showed differences\namong all modelsâ€™ performances in the goodness of fitting and\nprediction reliability based on the data size. Also, some models are\nmore sensitive to removing the outlier than others. For example, Duong\nand Wangâ€™s models seemed to be less affected by removing the\noutlier compared to Weng, Hesieh, stretched exponential production\ndecline (SEPD), logistic growth (LGM), and fractional decline curve\n(FDC) models. Further, the extended exponential decline curve analysis\n(EEDCA) and the hyperbolicâ€“exponential hybrid decline (HEHD)\nmodels tended to underestimate the reserves, and by removing the outlier,\nthey tended to be more underestimators. This work presented a comparative\nanalysis among 16 different DCA models based on removing the outlier\nusing ML. This may motivate researchers for further investigations\nto conclude which combination of the outlier removers and DCA models\ncould be used to improve production forecasting and reserve estimation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Yehia","given":"Taha"},{"family":"Khattab","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Tantawy","given":"Mahmoud"},{"family":"Mahgoub","given":"Ismail"}],"citation-key":"yehiaRemovingOutlierProduction2022","container-title":"ACS Omega","container-title-short":"ACS Omega","DOI":"10.1021/acsomega.2c03238","ISSN":"2470-1343","issue":"36","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,29]]},"page":"32046-32061","PMCID":"PMC9476512","PMID":"36120036","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Removing the Outlier from the Production Data for the Decline Curve Analysis of Shale Gas Reservoirs: A Comparative Study Using Machine Learning","title-short":"Removing the Outlier from the Production Data for the Decline Curve Analysis of Shale Gas Reservoirs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9476512/","volume":"7"}
